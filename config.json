points:		This is the font size
		I highly recommend leaving this at 9 as the GUI gets too big
		However on large screens you could increase it slightly
		Note that the pictures are hardcode and will not change size

overlayFolder:	This is the folder that all of the notes and tree are stored in
		By default this is _Overlays_, which has generic leveling notes already
		If you plan on making custom notes, I recommend copying the _Overlays_ folder
		Make all your changes in the new folder so updates don't overwrite your work
		This way you can also store notes for different builds and switch easily
		I don't recommend going lower as the UI covers a lot of screen

treeSide:	Which side of the screen to show the passive tree overlay
		The default is the right so it does not interfere with the Health globe
		However, you can change it to left to not block the inventory instead

treeName:	This is the name of file that should be used for the passive tree overlay
		The default is tree.jpg but you can use any valid image file name/type
		Just make sure the file exists in the Overlay/Tree folder

maxNotesWidth:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Notes GUI will be
		Notes are per zone tips based on text files in the Overlay folder
		Cannot be smaller than 30

maxGuideWidth:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Guide GUI will be
		The Guide is tips based on notes.txt in each Act folder
		Cannot be smaller than 22

maxLinksWidth:	How many characters should be shown before cutting off text
		The longer this is the larger the Links GUI will be
		The Links show colored notes based on gems.json

guideXoffset:	How much space to leave on the right side of the screen for the guide
		1 = All the way to right (covers the map/info)
		This is a good setting if you're going to Alt+F2 and hide the notes
		.855 = As far right as you can go without covering the Mini-Map
		Great setting if you don't use the overlay map
		.8 = Default setting, as far right as you can go without covering anything

levelXoffset:	How far to the right of the screen to put the exp tracker
		.287 = As far to the left as you can go without covering the flasks on a normal resolution
		.589 = As far to the right as you can go without covering the skill bar on a normal resolution
		This is the default and a great option for normal screen resolutions
		Experiment with other numbers if you want to move the exp tracker around

levelYoffset:	How much space to leave on the bottom of the screen for the exp tracker
		1 = All the way at bottom (it will be off the screen)
		I guess you could do this if you never want to see it
		.955 = As far down as you can go without covering the level progress bar
		This is the default and a great option for normal screen resolutions
		.885 = near the top of the flasks bar
		This is a decent option if you're using a strange resolution like 1680x1050

gemsYoffset:	How far down you want the gems tracker
		0 = All the way at top of the screen
		It will cover your buffs and debuffs
		.180 = Just below you buffs and debuffs
		This is the default and a great option for normal screen resolutions
		Feel free to experiment with other numbers if you want it lower

opacity:	Lower this number to see through the images and notes more
		200 makes the text crisp but can be hard to see through
		150 is still readable but some backgrounds make it hard

startHidden:	Should the overlay display on startup
		By default it will so new users see that it is working
		However if you would like it just as a reference you can change this value to 1

displayTimeout: How long in seconds before auto hiding the control bar
		By default it will hide after 10 seconds
		Setting the value to 0 will never hide it

persistText:	Should the Notes and Guide be shown after the timeout
		By default it will hide as well
		However if you want to see it after the timeout change this value to 1
