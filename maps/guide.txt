`The Atlas has been simplified, do the highest tier map you have and just socket watchstones evenly among the regions
`If you're low on maps from a certain region, socket less watchstones in the other regions so it is the only one that has maps of the tier you want
`Focus on completing maps you have not done to improve your sustain

watchstones:2
`Make sure you are Alching to sustain maps

watchstones:4
`Make sure you are Alching and Vaaling now to sustain maps

watchstones:6
`Make sure you are Chiseling and Alching and Vaaling now to sustain maps

watchstones:8
`Make sure you are Chiseling and Alching and Vaaling as well as using sextants on the watchstones now to sustain maps

`At this point you technically have enough stones to farm any single map you want at awakener level 3, if you just want to target farm a T16 put 4 stones in that region and less than 4 in every other region and keep going for the atlas completion bonus
`By now you should be trying to replace all of them with
Ivory/Chromium/Platinum/Titanium stones to improve your farming

watchstones:16
`Congratulations, you got all the watchstones!
`The conquerors will spawn anywhere with 4 stones now, so you can farm them and Sirus freely
